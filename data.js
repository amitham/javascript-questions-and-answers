        question: "Explain imutability and mutability with details",
        answer: "Imutable object is an object which we cannot modify the state of it after it is created mutable object is otherway around we can change the state evern after we create the object. In javascript mutability is bad, because it can leads to errors in code and give hrad time to track it down. So, in order to get this done we can use higher order functions like map,reduce,filter,etc to create new copy of those data/objects. But this can cost us time and space. But we can use persistent data structures for efficient immutability. (there are some libraries already implemented using persistent data structures. ex: immutable.js)
